# chemKit
A light weight matlab library for manipulating chemical formulas, generating 3D structure, Gaussian Input files and so on. 
For now, it only has one slightly complex functionality, namely doing force field optimization using UFF forcefield. 
Could be an ideal demonstration of How GDIIS algorithm works. It also contains BFGS hessian update and Steepest descent optimizer.
